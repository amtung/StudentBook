C4Q student book is a mobile app that displays information about students in my 3.2 Access Code iOS program. Starts with a tour page that goes over what C4Q's mission is and what Access Code is all about. After that you will see a login page, students are able to log in with their email and student ID. Then they will be brought to a list of students with the option to filter by first or last name. Once you click into a student's name, it will bring you to a view where it displays their picture, Github and LinkedIn links along with a short personal description.

Version 2.0 to come!
